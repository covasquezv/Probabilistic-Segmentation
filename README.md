[Paper: A Probabilistic U-Net for Segmentation of Ambiguous Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05034.pdf)

Based on:
Re-implementation of the model described in 'A Probabilistic U-Net for Segmentation of Ambiguous Images'. Available [here](https://github.com/SimonKohl/probabilistic_unet).

U-Net architecture based on: [Deep learning to achieve clinically applicable segmentation of head and neck anatomy for radiotherapy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04430.pdf)

Residual approach implemented
